# US Midterm 2026 Indicators: Early Vote, Ballot

Eleven days before the 2026 midterm, the national generic ballot, early-ballot counts and the party split of early voters, lined up against the same point in 2018, 2022 and 2024.

Published by [Carmena’s Overton & Electoral Research](https://carmenaresearch.com/), an independent, non-partisan US election research firm. These are the public tables behind our charts. Party means voter registration, not vote choice, unless a column says otherwise. Figures are compared at the same number of days before Election Day in each year.

## Provenance and method
Carmena’s Overton compiles cumulative early-ballot counts from state and county election records and joins them to voter registration and vote history. Calculations are ours; the method is described on our [methodology page](https://carmenaresearch.com/methodology/). Last updated 2026-10-23. Updated as our tracking runs, typically weekly during the early-voting period.

## Caveats
- Party is not vote choice. TargetSmart models party in 21 states holding 48% of 2026 early votes (Oct 23, 2026).
- 2022 polls understated Republicans: R+0.6 in the average at this point, R+2.7 in the House vote.
- The early-ballot share uses 2022 total turnout (109,979,856) and 2024 total turnout (156,766,239) as denominators.
- 2026 uses the Silver Bulletin average; 2018 and 2022 use 538’s average. The methods differ.
- 2022 polls understated Republicans by about 2 points from this point.
- Party is not vote choice.
- Democrats have voted early in larger numbers since 2020.
- TargetSmart models party in 21 states; on Oct 23, 2026 they held 48% of early votes.
- NBC publishes whole percentages, so each share is precise to about half a point.
- 2022 polls understated Republicans: R+0.6 in the average, R+2.7 in the House vote.
- The 2026 share is of 2022’s total turnout; the 2024 share is of 2024’s. Raw ballots are at 61% of 2024’s pace, a presidential year.
- TargetSmart models party in 21 states, and party is not vote choice. Democrats have voted early in larger numbers since 2020.
- “Not marked as modelled” is NBC’s labelling, not a check we ran.
